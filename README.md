### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: About
This is my first project using React and thefore it may be expected that some errors and some not "good pratice" code may be found, if you do found it feel free to create a issue pointing that and i will try to fix it.<br>
This is a simple project that uses React to create 2 pages where one of them consumes an API([PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/)) to generate content in realtime.<br>

:bookmark: **Main Branch**: Stable production Branch that is auto deployed to online version.<br>
:bookmark: **Dev Branch**: Day to Day development, may contain errors and "strange" codes.

**Disclaimer:** The original layout design is not mine, this a modified version, for privacy reasons i'll not disclose the original owner. Authorization for using the design is still pending and because of that the actual design may change in the future

#### &emsp;:bookmark: General
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:large_blue_diamond:**When will this project be update:question:**<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:arrow_forward: **TL;DR:** Pls look at [Status](#diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside-Status)<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:arrow_forward: **Long Answer:** That will depend on a lot of variables like how much work is needed to complet the next feature being worked on, what is the actual Status of this project, how much free time i have at the moment and many other factors.<br>
I'll always try to update any project that is still supported by me as fast as i can, but if i think that something may take more time than normally needed i'll try to inform through this README([Annonucements](#diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside-Annonucements)).<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:large_blue_diamond:**I've found a error, bug, problem and/or code bad pratice in your project, how can i contact you:question:**<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:arrow_forward: **TL;DR:** Just create a [issue](https://github.com/herbert-wander/PokemonReactTest/issues)<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;:arrow_forward: **Long Answer:** You can generally create an [issue](https://github.com/herbert-wander/PokemonReactTest/issues), but if you think that this is not enough you can go to [Contacts](#diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside-Contacts) and try to reach me using one of that options.
